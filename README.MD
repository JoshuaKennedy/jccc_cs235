Projects from CS 235 at JCCC
==========

These are some labs and projects that I worked on for CS 235 (formerly CIS 235) at Johnson County Community College.

CS 235 is Object-Oriented Programming in C++, which introduces concepts of the object oriented programming paradigm such as data abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
It also goes over features of C++ such as dynamic memory, pointers, built-in classes, function and operator overloading, exception handling, recursion and templates.
