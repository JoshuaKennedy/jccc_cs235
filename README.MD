Projects from CS 235 at JCCC
==========

These are some labs and projects that I worked on for CS 235 (formerly CIS 235) at Johnson County Community College.

CS 235 is Object-Oriented Programming in C++, which introduces concepts of the object oriented programming paradigm such as data abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
It also goes over features of C++ such as dynamic memory, pointers, built-in classes, function and operator overloading, exception handling, recursion and templates.

Code
------
Some of the assignments have an Xcode project and some of them have Visual Studio projects and some don't have any.

They should all compile on any compiler OS, but I have tested some of them on OS X using the LLVM compiler and some of them on Visual Studio 2012 and 2013.
